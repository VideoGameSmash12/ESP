For as long as spectator mode has existed, TotalFreedom has blocked it because it bypassed /tptoggle. This was the case for years and there wasn't a need for this plugin. However, Ryan added a new plugin to the server in 2022 called BuildersUtilities. One of the plugin's features was "noclip", which would put you into Spectator Mode if you were near the ground to simulate noclipping into the ground. Unfortunately there wasn't an adequate way to disable the teleportation feature in a free-op environment, so for quite a while people were abusing it to intentionally bypass other players' disabled teleportation.

So, I created this quick plugin specifically to block that. It's a simple plugin that requires Essentials, TotalFreedomMod, and ProtocolLib. There is no configuration needed nor any commands, it simply intercepts spectator teleportation packets to check if the target has their teleportation disabled and if the packet sender is not an admin, and if both of these are the case then it blocks the packet and sends an error message that ressembles Essentials'.
