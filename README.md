For as long as spectator mode has existed, TotalFreedom has blocked it because it bypassed /tptoggle. This was the case for years and there wasn't a need for this plugin. However, Ryan added a new plugin to the server in 2022 called BuildersUtilities. One of the plugin's features was "noclip", which would put you into Spectator Mode if you were near the ground to simulate noclipping into the ground. Unfortunately there wasn't an adequate way to disable the teleportation feature in a free-op environment, so for quite a while people were abusing it to intentionally bypass other players' /tptoggle.

So, I created this quick plugin specifically to block that. It's a simple plugin that requires Essentials, TotalFreedomMod, and ProtocolLib.
